### Esssential Questions

1. Interpreting User Needs and Implementing them into a Program:
To understand what users want in a program, we listen to their needs and create simple descriptions called user stories. These stories help us know what features to build and prioritize them based on what users value.

2. Approach to Developing Programs and Incorporating Agile Processes:
When developing programs, I work in small steps and collaborate with others to make improvements continuously. In the future, I plan to use agile methods like Scrum and Kanban to be more productive, flexible, and customer-focused. Agile processes help us focus on user needs, adapt to changes quickly, and deliver software in small, useful parts.

3. Qualities of a Good Team Member in Software Development:
Good team members in software development are:
- Good Communicators: They share ideas and work well with others.
- Team Players: They collaborate with teammates and support team goals.
- Problem-Solvers: They can find and fix issues efficiently.
- Flexible: They are open to change and learning new things.
